# NLP Project: Multi-Head Attention and NLP Techniques

## Project Overview
This repository contains notebooks focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with an emphasis on **multi-head attention mechanisms** and related applications. The project explores how NLP models utilize attention to achieve state-of-the-art results in tasks like text classification, translation, and summarization.

## Contents

### 1. **BERT Multi-Head Attention Notebook**
- **Filename**: `Bert_multi_head_attention.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - Explains the architecture and functionality of the multi-head attention mechanism in BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
  - Visualizes the attention process across different heads and layers.
  - Demonstrates how multi-head attention helps capture different aspects of the input text.
- **Key Features**:
  - Implementation of multi-head attention from scratch.
  - Visualization of attention scores.
  - Detailed walkthrough of BERT's transformer-based architecture.

### 2. **General NLP Techniques Notebook**
- **Filename**: `Notebook_Nlp.ipynb`
- **Description**:
  - A comprehensive guide to NLP techniques.
  - Includes text preprocessing, tokenization, and embedding techniques.
  - Demonstrates the use of pre-trained models and fine-tuning strategies.
- **Key Features**:
  - Practical examples using popular NLP libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow/Keras, or PyTorch).
  - Insights into handling datasets for text-based tasks.
  - End-to-end implementation of an NLP model.
